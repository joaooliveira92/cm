/**
 * PROTOTYPE — throwaway. See ./README.md.
 *
 * Host for ticket 06's three map variants.
 *
 * "Three variants of the strategic map screen, switchable via `?variant=`,
 * mounted as a dev-only campaign screen because no map screen exists yet."
 *
 * The host owns the *data* — selection, ruler, layers, projection — and hands
 * it to whichever variant is showing. It owns no layout: each variant draws
 * the whole page, including its own chrome, because layout is the thing being
 * compared. Switching variant preserves state, which is the point: the same
 * selected area and the same laid ruler render three different ways.

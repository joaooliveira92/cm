/**
 * PROTOTYPE — throwaway. See ./README.md.
 *
 * One-off author-time bake for ticket 06's geometry-source question. Fetches
 * Natural Earth land (public domain), decodes it, and emits plain lon/lat
 * rings as a TypeScript module.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately proves, both claims from ticket 13's research:
 *
 * 1. The geometry pipeline runs entirely at author time and needs no runtime
 *    dependency — no d3-geo, no topojson-client, nothing added to
 *    apps/desktop/package.json. TopoJSON arc decoding is the ~40 lines below.
 * 2. TopoJSON's compaction is worth having, so the *projection* can stay at
 *    render time and the projection choice becomes a live toggle rather than a
 *    bake-time commitment.
 *
 * **Tier is the fidelity knob.** Natural Earth publishes three, and the number
 * is the map scale each is *drawn for*: 110m is a world thumbnail, 50m a
 * continent, 10m a coastline. The camera zooms to 14x (usePrototypeCamera's
 * MAX_SCALE), which is roughly 1:1.5M at the equator — two whole tiers past
 * what 110m carries, which is why 110m goes visibly polygonal when you zoom
 * into the Aegean or the Danish straits. For a naval game the coast *is* the
 * subject, so 10m is the default here.
 *
 * Run:  pnpm tsx apps/desktop/src/renderer/screens/map-prototype/bake-coastline.ts [110m|50m|10m]

/**
 * Quantization is set per tier to just under the tier's own resolution, so it
 * only drops points the source never really resolved.
 *
 * `minExtentDegrees` is the speck cull, and it is the whole reason 10m is
 * affordable. 10m land is 5,848 polygons at full detail, which is within
 * sight of ticket 13's ~8,000-element SVG degradation threshold — but the
 * overwhelming majority are single uninhabited rocks. Culling by bounding-box
 * extent keeps the coastline resolution (the point of the tier) while
 * discarding subpaths that are sub-pixel at max zoom. 0.1° is ~11 km, which
 * still keeps every island this game names: Malta is ~0.25°, Gibraltar sits
 * on the Iberian polygon, Heligoland ~0.03° is gone and does not matter.

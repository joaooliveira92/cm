# Screen 36: Reserve Squad

> **Clean-room notice:** This specification describes an original football-management simulation inspired by early-2000s management games. Use original text, visuals, and fictional or properly licensed data.

---

## 1. Purpose

Reserve Squad manages players assigned to the club’s secondary team, including first-team fringe players, returning injured players, reserve specialists, and eligible youth participants.

## 2. Primary user goals

- Open reserve player profiles
- Promote or demote eligible players
- Set first-team players available for reserve matches
- Review reserve fixtures, results, tactics, and eligibility
- Apply bulk squad movement with a preview

## 3. Navigation context

```text
Global Application Shell
  -> Club
  -> Reserve Squad
  -> Linked club, person, competition, fixture, or workflow
```

The screen preserves the viewed club independently from the manager's controlled club. Actions available for the controlled club may be read-only or absent when viewing another club.

## 4. Conceptual layout

```text
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NORTH UNITED > RESERVE SQUAD                      22 players                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Next reserve fixture: South Town Reserves, 16 February                       |
| Player              Eligibility      Fitness      First-team status           |
| Jordan Prospect     Eligible         Match fit    Available for promotion     |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Move to First Team] [Set Available for Reserves] [Reserve Tactics]    [Back]|
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The layout is conceptual and must use an original presentation system.

## 5. Core data model

```typescript
interface ReserveSquadModel {
  readonly clubId: string;
  readonly reserveTeamId: string;
  readonly competitionId?: string;
  readonly rows: readonly ReserveSquadPlayerRow[];
  readonly nextFixture?: FixtureSummary;
  readonly registrationRules: ReserveEligibilitySummary;
  readonly revision: number;
}
```

Renderer-facing data must be immutable per revision, serializable, and validated at process or network boundaries.

## 6. Principal interactions

- Open reserve player profiles
- Promote or demote eligible players
- Set first-team players available for reserve matches
- Review reserve fixtures, results, tactics, and eligibility
- Apply bulk squad movement with a preview

## 7. View states

- `loading`
- `ready`
- `refreshing`
- `empty`
- `filtered_empty`
- `permission_limited`
- `unavailable`
- `error`

Asynchronous requests use request revisions and cancellation. Late responses from a prior club, filter, tab, or manager context must be discarded.

## 8. Permissions and knowledge

- Public club data is broadly visible.
- Private budgets, contracts, scouting, relationships, board confidence, and tactical information require explicit permission.
- The active manager and current career revision determine visibility.
- Client rendering state never grants access.
- Unknown information remains Unknown rather than being estimated from hidden values.

## 9. Sorting, filtering, and search

- Use stable entity IDs and deterministic tie-breakers.
- Filters change visibility only.
- Hidden selection remains selected with a notice.
- Search is locale-aware, debounced, bounded, and cancellable.
- Large lists are virtualized and preserve stable row identity.

## 10. Empty and error states

Distinguish no data, no filter matches, unavailable entity, permission denied, offline authority, stale revision, and operational failure. Preserve the last valid view during recoverable refresh failures.

## 11. Accessibility

- Use persistent headings and labels.
- Expose data lists as accessible grids or lists.
- Announce meaningful updates without reading every changed cell.
- Never communicate status by color alone.
- Restore focus after linked views and dialogs.
- Support keyboard-only use, reduced motion, high contrast, 200 percent text scaling, and right-to-left layouts.

## 12. Localization

- Localize labels, dates, times, numbers, currencies, units, statuses, and plural forms.
- Preserve stable IDs independently from display names.
- Apply locale-aware sorting and search.
- Preserve native scripts and person-name order.
- Use complete message templates rather than concatenated translated fragments.

## 13. Responsive behavior

- Wide layouts may use summary and detail columns.
- Narrow layouts stack filters, content, details, and actions.
- High scaling moves secondary metadata onto additional lines.
- Primary navigation and Back remain reachable.
- Ultrawide displays use readable maximum widths.

## 14. Performance

- Query compact read models instead of complete world graphs.
- Virtualize long player, staff, fixture, transfer, and history lists.
- Cancel stale requests and rate-limit live updates.
- Cache only permission-safe derived data using full revision fingerprints.
- Keep heavy sorting and aggregation outside the renderer.

## 15. Security and integrity

- Treat club, person, competition, user, and provider text as untrusted.
- Render labels as text or constrained structured content.
- Validate route parameters, stable IDs, filters, revisions, and actions in a trusted layer.
- Enforce permissions on the host or application service.
- Use expected revisions and idempotency keys for mutations.
- Store money with explicit currency and minor units.
- Sanitize exported and copied diagnostics.
- Reject events for inactive career, club, or manager contexts.

## 16. Screen-specific rules

- Reserve assignment, registration, and match availability are separate concepts
- Moving a player must not silently alter contract or first-team registration
- Competition age and foreign-player rules require authoritative validation
- Shared first-team and reserve fixtures must prevent impossible double selection

## 17. Persistence

Persist only safe view preferences, manager-scoped filters, column selections, and authorized drafts. Do not persist stale private read models, hover state, unvalidated actions, or plaintext secrets.

## 18. Observability

Record query duration, result category, revision conflicts, and safe error codes. Avoid recording private finances, scouting findings, notebook content, complete names, or hidden attributes in general telemetry.

## 19. Edge cases

- The club changes competition during a season transition.
- A selected player, staff member, fixture, or transfer becomes unavailable.
- The active manager changes while the screen is open.
- Viewer permissions change remotely.
- The career revision advances during refresh.
- A filter hides the selected row.
- The same mutation is submitted twice.
- The host disconnects or migrates.

## 20. Acceptance criteria

1. Reserve assignment, registration, and match availability are separate concepts
2. Moving a player must not silently alter contract or first-team registration
3. Competition age and foreign-player rules require authoritative validation
4. Shared first-team and reserve fixtures must prevent impossible double selection
5. The screen distinguishes loading, empty, permission-limited, unavailable, and failed states.
6. Navigation and actions use stable IDs and current revisions.
7. Keyboard and assistive-technology users can access all visible information and actions.
8. No proprietary source-game assets or copied wording are required.

## 21. Recommended tests

- Normal authorized view.
- Read-only view of another club.
- Permission-limited data.
- Stale asynchronous response.
- Deleted linked entity.
- Large virtualized result set.
- Keyboard navigation.
- Screen-reader semantics.
- High text scaling.
- Right-to-left layout.

## 22. Condensed LLM implementation brief

```text
Implement Reserve Squad for an original football-management simulation. Use stable
entity IDs, compact immutable revisioned read models, authoritative permission
and knowledge checks, cancellable asynchronous queries, deterministic sorting,
virtualized lists, safe navigation, and idempotent revision-bound mutations.
Preserve the active manager's privacy and never infer hidden information. Support
keyboard use, accessible list and grid semantics, visible focus, high text
scaling, localization, and right-to-left layouts. Treat all labels, IDs, money,
user content, links, and renderer commands as untrusted. Do not copy proprietary
artwork, exact wording, source code, logos, or databases.
```
